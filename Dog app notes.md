Dog app notes:



Started with generating a series of images using stable diffusion to have some kind of design idea

Once i got an idea, i made the page mok-up using canva

i generated the picture of the dog using stable diffusion and made it into an svg



planning: decided what functionalities i should include. Googled around to find out how dog nutrition is calculates

early on decided on autosuggest function so had to find API. also wanted to use API for final calculation.



code: started with the html. referred to w3 schools for reference for form structure.

chose to do this with vanilla css, js before i move onto frameworks in the next project
